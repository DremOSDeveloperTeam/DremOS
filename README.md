# Welcome to the Official DremOS Website

# DremOS

DremOS is a fast and lightweight OS. It originally started on SUSEStudio which since has shut down, so since 0.5.0 it was turned into a large repository of applications to be downloaded in a zip.

# Installation

Installation is easy and is done in 3 steps.

Step 1.) Download <code>install-dremos-x.x.x.zip</code> from the Releases page. This will be a large file. (x.x.x is for version)
Step 2.) Extract the .zip. There will be a folder named "apps" an a .sh file named install.sh.
Step 3.) In a terminal and in the same directory as the .sh and apps folder, type in <code>./install.sh</code>

# Compatibility

Almost any x64 or x86_64 PC will be able to run DremOS.

## Recommended Requirements

RAM: 4GBs

CPU: 2.1GHZ Dual-core

GPU: Integrated graphics would work fine (every computer has it unless it is the ENIAC or UNIVAC or something)

WiFI or Ethernet connectivity is strongly recommended.

# How to install

Step 1.) Download the ISO for DremOS (latest is recomended).

Step 2.) Download Rufus <a href="https://rufus.akeo.ie/">here</a>

Step 3.) Open Rufus and drag the ISO into Rufus.

Step 4.) Plug in an 8GB or more flash drive and select it.

Step 5.) Back up your USB flash drive (optional)

Step 6.) Press start

Step 7.) Plug the USB flash drive into the target PC and boot into it through BIOS (while it is booting).

BIOS keys are usualy ESC, F2, OR F12. If that does not work, look up BIOS key for your specific computer model.

Step 8.) Follow instructions to install

This will erase all data on your hard disk so back it up if you have anything important on it.
