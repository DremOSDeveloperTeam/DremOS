# Welcome to the Official DremOS Website

# DremOS

DremOS is a fast and lightweight OS. It originally started on SUSEStudio which since has shut down, so since 0.6.0 it has turned into an Ubuntu distro.

# Installation 

### Step 1.) Download DremOS
It is strongly recommended to use the latest build as it will have the most features and better security than older builds.

### Step 2.) Depending on your computer, you may have multiple options here.

Option 1 (disk Drive): If your coputer has a disk drive, you can burn the iso to a DVD and install off of it.

Option 2 (thumb drive): This is a faster way to install. To do this, download Rufus <a href="https://rufus.akeo.ie/">here</a> and flash the image to a thumb drive with at least 8GBs of storage.

### Step 3.) Installation

When starting up your computer with the thumbdrive or DVD in your it, press your computer's boot selector key (usualy a key like ESC, F2, F8, F12, etc.). You can find this out by searching your computer's model number on its manufacturer's site. Select your thumbdrive or DVD to boot. When it boots, select the Install button. The installation should be very simple from here.

## DremOS 0.6.0 ("Foxtrot")

We're going to be completly honest, our entire team didn't notice that we havn't made 0.5.0 until it was too late, so we bring you DremOS 0.6.0 codenamed Foxtrot.

<a href="https://github.com/samparisot/DremOS/releases/download/0.6.0/DremOS-0.6.0.iso">Download</a>

Note: DremOS 0.6.0 has not been released yet, so this link will not work.

Expected release date: Unknown

### Update Notes

Since DremOS 0.6.0 is the first version of DremOS to be Ubuntu-based, this version won't be as feature rich due to us having to go back to square one. We will try to get more features on later updates.

+Steam

+WINE

+DOSBox

+Java JRE

+Visual Studio Code

~All features you would normally find on Ubuntu such as Libreoffice and Firefox

# Compatibility

Almost any x64 or x86_64 PC will be able to run DremOS.

## Recommended Requirements

RAM: 4GBs

CPU: 2.1GHZ Dual-core

GPU: Integrated graphics would work fine (every computer has it unless it is the ENIAC or UNIVAC or something)

WiFI or Ethernet connectivity is strongly recommended.

# Recovered SUSE-based OSes
We have recovered every old OS (except for 0.4.0) in case you wanted to try them out.
