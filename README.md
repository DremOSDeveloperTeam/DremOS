# Welcome to the Official DremOS Website

# DremOS

DremOS is a fast and lightweight OS. It originally started on SUSEStudio which since has shut down, so since 0.5.0 it was turned into a large repository of applications to be downloaded in a zip.

# Installation

Installation is easy and is done in 3 steps.

Step 1.) Download <code>install-dremos-x.x.x.zip</code> from the Releases page. This will be a large file. (x.x.x is for version)
Step 2.) Extract the .zip. There will be a folder named "apps" an a .sh file named install.sh.
Step 3.) In a terminal and in the same directory as the .sh and apps folder, type in <code>./install.sh</code>
