# Welcome to the Official DremOS Website (old)

## Notice: This site has been discontinued. Please go to the <a href="https://sparrdrem.github.io/DremOS">new site.</a>

Latest Version: 0.3.x

Project Status: Active
Release date for the next version: 6/6/19 5 P.M. (CST)

# What Is DremOS?

DremOS is a fast and lightweight OS. It originally started on SUSEStudio which since has shut down, so since 0.6.0 it has turned into an xUbuntu distro.

# Installation 

### Step 1.) Download DremOS
It is strongly recommended to use the latest build as it will have the most features and better security than older builds.

### Step 2.) Depending on your computer, you may have multiple options here.

Option 1 (disk Drive): If your computer has a disk drive, you can burn the iso to a DVD and install off of it.

Option 2 (thumb drive): This is a faster way to install. To do this, download Rufus <a href="https://rufus.akeo.ie/">here</a> and flash the image to a thumb drive with at least 8GBs of storage.

### Step 3.) Installation

When starting up your computer with the thumbdrive or DVD in your it, press your computer's boot selector key (usualy a key like ESC, F2, F8, F12, etc.). You can find this out by searching your computer's model number on its manufacturer's site. Select your thumbdrive or DVD to boot. When it boots, select the Install button. The installation should be very simple from here.

# Downloads

## DremOS 0.6.0 ("Foxtrot")

Let's just skip 0.5.0. We bring you DremOS 0.6.0 codenamed Foxtrot!

<!-- <a href="https://github.com/samparisot/DremOS/releases/download/0.6.0/DremOS-0.6.0.iso">Download</a> -->

Expected release date: 6/6/19 5 P.M. (CST)

### Update Notes

Since DremOS 0.6.0 is the first version of DremOS to be Ubuntu-based, this version won't be as feature rich due to us having to go back to square one. We will try to get more features on later updates.

+RetroArch

+VirtualBox

+Chromium (replaces Firefox)

+DOSBox

~All features you would normally find on Ubuntu such as Libreoffice

# Compatibility

Almost any x64 or x86_64 PC will be able to run DremOS.

## Recommended Requirements

RAM: 4GBs

CPU: 2.1GHZ Dual-core

GPU: Integrated graphics would work fine (every computer has it unless it is the ENIAC or UNIVAC or something)

WiFI or Ethernet connectivity is strongly recommended.

# Recovered SUSE-based OSes
We have recovered every old OS (except for 0.4.0) in case you wanted to try them out.

## Downloads
DremOS Alfa (1.x), Bravo (2.x), and Charlie (3.x) are tightly packed into a single ~4.5GB ZIP file and is downloadable <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1lFdUuK4Cgp5VHfYCZQYzZs9aYLhLVL_3">Here</a>

DremOS 0.4.0 has been lost in time... sorry about that!

Note: This OS may be a pain to install, and will probably not install on any Apple computer (iMac, MacBook, Mac Pro, etc.) due to the firmware it uses. VirtualBox (or maybe VMWare) will be your best bet here.
