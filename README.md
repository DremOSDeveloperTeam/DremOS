# Update Notes

Since DremOS 0.5.0 is the first version of DremOS to be based on Ubuntu, this version won't be as feature rich. We will try to get more features on later updates.

+Ubuntu Builder
+Steam
+The normal programs you would find on Ubuntu.

### Compatibility

Almost any x64 or x86_64 PC will be able to run DremOS

### How to install

Step 1.) Download the ISO for DremOS (latest is recomended).
Step 2.) Download Rufus <a href="https://rufus.akeo.ie/">here</a>
Step 3.) Open Rufus and drag the ISO into Rufus.
Step 4.) Plug in an 8GB or more flash drive and select it.
Step 5.) Back up your USB flash drive (optional)
Step 6.) Press start
Step 7.) Plug the USB flash drive into the target PC and boot into it through BIOS (while it is booting).
             BIOS keys are usualy ESC, F2, OR F12. If that does not work, look up BIOS key for your specific computer model.
Step 8.) Follow instructions to install
             This will erase all data on your hard disk so back it up if you have anything important on it.

Note: It may not be the easiest to install this as it does not use EFI, even with Rufus.
