# Welcome to the Official DremOS Website

# DremOS

DremOS is a fast and lightweight OS. It originally started on SUSEStudio which since has shut down, so since 0.5.0 it is based on Ubuntu. DremOS is possibly the greatest Ubuntu-based OS because it has everything you need and is possibly better then the past DremOS. We have continued our work using a program named Ubuntu Builder because ExpressBuild wasn't a new SUSEStudio at all. It simply allowed you to build appliances but did not allow you to edit them to the extent SUSEStudio did.

# Downloads

## DremOS 0.6.0

DremOS 0.6.0 is going to begin development when the ISO for DremOS 0.5.0 has been uploaded.

### Planned Update Notes

This update is to get DremOS a little over where it was before. DremOS 0.5.0 was simply made to say DremOS isn't dead and refuses to die and to make it an Ubuntu-based OS.

~Logo changes and other fun stuff like that

+WINE

+Java JRE 8

+Installer for DOSBox

+Visual Studio Code

## DremOS 0.5.0

<a href="https://github.com/samparisot/DremOS/releases/download/0.5.0/DremOS-0.5.0.iso">Download</a>

Note: DremOS 0.5.0 has not been released yet, so this link will not work.

Expected release date: Before 3/11/18

### Update Notes

Since DremOS 0.5.0 is the first version of DremOS to be based on Ubuntu, this version won't be as feature rich. We will try to get more features on later updates.

! DremOS uses XFCE4 as a Window Manager/Desktop

+Steam

+Ubuntu Builder (may have failed but it will probably be on the root of your installation (we're getting used to the program))

+The normal programs you would find on Ubuntu, such as LibreOffice.

# Compatibility

Almost any x64 or x86_64 PC will be able to run DremOS.

## Recommended Requirements

RAM: 4GBs

CPU: 2.1GHZ Dual-core

GPU: Integrated graphics would work fine (every computer has it unless it is the ENIAC or UNIVAC or something)

WiFI or Ethernet connectivity is strongly recommended.

# How to install

Step 1.) Download the ISO for DremOS (latest is recomended).

Step 2.) Download Rufus <a href="https://rufus.akeo.ie/">here</a>

Step 3.) Open Rufus and drag the ISO into Rufus.

Step 4.) Plug in an 8GB or more flash drive and select it.

Step 5.) Back up your USB flash drive (optional)

Step 6.) Press start

Step 7.) Plug the USB flash drive into the target PC and boot into it through BIOS (while it is booting).

BIOS keys are usualy ESC, F2, OR F12. If that does not work, look up BIOS key for your specific computer model.

Step 8.) Follow instructions to install

This will erase all data on your hard disk so back it up if you have anything important on it.

# Recovered SUSE-based OSes

Currently the only recovered version of DremOS that was built on SUSEStudio is version 0.3.1.

Download: <a href="https://github.com/samparisot/DremOS/releases/download/0.3.1/DremOS_Ultimate_Edition.x86_64-0.1.0.iso">DremOS 0.3.1</a>

Note: This OS may be a pain to install, and will probably not install on any Apple computer (iMac, MacBook, Mac Pro, etc.) due to the firmware it uses.
